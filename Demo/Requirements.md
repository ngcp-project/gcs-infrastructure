# Vehicle
## Requirements
| Requirement | Description | Derives From |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Vehicle-01 | The vehicle SHALL receive user defined mission states and locations, search areas, keep in zones, and keep out zones from the GCS. | GCS-13 |
| Vehicle-02 | The vehicle SHALL respond to an emergency stop/loiter command from the GCS | GCS-14 |
| Vehicle-03 | The vehicle SHALL transmit telemetry data at a rate of at least 1 Hz. (1 transmission per second) | MRA-15, ERU-16, MEA-13, GCS-06, GCS-21 | 

According to the RFP, only the MRA needs to obey geofence boundaries? (MRA-08)

## Software Requirements
| Requirement | Description | Derives From |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
